***NgRx (Angular Reactive extentions) Notes***
===========================================================================
(1.0) Introduction :
git_URL : 'https://github.com/angular-university' 
repo_Name : ngrx-course

+clone and open course

run command : npm install
	    : git checkout 1-start
	    : git branch
	    : npm run server
	    : npm start
drowbacks of old approch : we have to fetch data each time when the application reloads.
			 : bad user experience
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
State: it is the data received via API calls, user inputs, presentation UI State, app preferences, etc
Store: The store is what holds the app's state. 

Action: A unique event dispatched from components and services that describe how the state should be changed.
 For example, ‘Add Customer’ can be an action that will change the state (i.e. add a new customer to the list).

Reducer: All the state changes happen inside the reducer; it responds to the action and, based on that action, 
it will create a new immutable state and return it to the store.

Selector: Selector is a function used for obtaining a part of the state from the store.

Effect: A mechanism that listens for dispatched actions in an observable stream, processes the server response, 
and returns new actions either immediately or asynchronously to the reducer to change the state. Please note that 
we are not using 'effect' in this example app.
============================================================================
(1.1) use ngrx in owr code :
to add ngrx run command : ng add @ngrx/store
then run command : ng add @ngrx/store-devtools

install extention : Redux Devtools

+npm start 

run command : ng generate store auth/Auth --module auth.module.ts

to create module : ng g module my-components  OR
npx ng generate module CustomerDashboard --project=angular-ngrx-course

ckeck version of node:node --version
	&Angular cli :ng version
